### About 

Todo application
This is a very simple todo app that created to familiarise myself with creating a CRUD (Create, read, update, delete) application. I used ReactJS for my forntend and Firebase for backend services.
I used the Firebase database to add, update and delete Todo tasks in the backend. Firebase hosting is used to deploy the application.
